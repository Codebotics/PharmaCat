### Winner of the 24 hours Hackathon conducted by Microsoft Innovations Club,VIT Chennai and sponsored by Geek for Geeks.

# Pharmacat
A cutting edge Open Source HealthCare app(Android+Web) which utilizes Machine Learning to predict diseases based on Symptoms or Natural Language. Also includes features such as Live Chat with Doctors,Appointment Booking,Possible Drugs you can take and Specialist you can refer to.

## Motivation
With the amount of data present in today's age, we can diagnose common ailments and help reduce the workload on hospitals and doctors. Prognosis of common ailments through ML and NLP will also help patients save time and money by not having to travel long distances and physically consult doctors which is also tedious and time consuming. Moreover we still feel that having a doctor's final opinion is priceless and that ML cannot completely replace doctors. Hence our services provides virtual doctor consultations. Moreover in cases of emergency when going to a hospital is absolutely necessary we cannot waste time on booking appointments after reaching the hospital. Our service lets users check for doctors' availabiltiy in hospitals neraby and prebook appointments for emergency consultations. It also shows vacancies for particular doctors (those who sign-up) in nearby hospitals. We also provide basic medication suggestions for common aiements.

## ATTENTION 
This project is not meant for use in real life but rather provides a base on which a solid service can be built with the help of individuals from the healthcare industry.
This project was created solely for educational purposes and is not intended for commercial use. Please do not take any decisions without consulting a real doctor first.

The PharmaCat Project is divided into **2 sections**:


...The PharmaCat Android Application (based on PharmaCat REST API) 

...The Web Application (utilizes Flask) and the corresponding API Server 

*To setup the Web Application along with API server do:*
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
venv\scripts\activate
```
**Then after activating the virtual environment do:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Dataset [`↩`](#jumpto)

This dataset is provided by **[Columbia University](https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html)**  and is a knowledge database of disease-symptom associations generated by an automated method based on information in textual discharge summaries of patients at New York Presbyterian Hospital admitted during 2004.  The first column shows the disease, the second the number of discharge summaries containing a positive and current mention of the disease, and the associated symptom. Associations for the 150 most frequent diseases based on these notes were computed and the symptoms are shown ranked based on the strength of association

**For NLP Based similarity search**

**[Drug Review Dataset (Drugs.com) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29)**

The dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10 star patient rating reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. The intention was to study

(1) sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets, i.e. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects,
(2) the transferability of models among domains, i.e. conditions, and
(3) the transferability of models among different data sources (see 'Drug Review Dataset (Druglib.com)').

The data is split into a train (75%) a test (25%) partition (see publication) and stored in two .tsv (tab-separated-values) files, respectively.
